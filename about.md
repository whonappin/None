Luis Aguilar Video Director

### More Information

Who Nappin is a video collective that produces the best short films for the price.

Only here can you find Enrique Gallardo's acting and writing brilliance. Check out his bullshockdragon channel for his self-proclaimed "interesting" video game commentaries.

Who Nappin hosts the acting talents of Richie D who shows us that he can play any part if the character is sad.

Josh D does everything from acting to casting and is better than Richie at FIFA.

Jared Crisostomo acts and writes for our channel. Check out his gaming channel TheManilaThrilla.

Adrian Diaz is a writer, producer, and actor for the channel. He's produced our <b>second</b> most expensive video Amiiboys.

The guy writing this bio is Luis Aguilar and I also write most of the videos. I shoot, edit, and direct all of our videos. Sometimes I make music. 

Friends of the channel that we thank for their contributions include:
Jeremie Carreon - Channel Artwork. Meme Lord. Check out his channel.
